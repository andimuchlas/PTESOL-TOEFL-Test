-- PASSAGE 6: The Industrial Revolution (Questions 51-60)
('reading', NULL, 51, 'Passage 6:\n\nThe Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late eighteenth century, marked a turning point in human history. This period saw the transition from manual production methods to machine-based manufacturing. The invention of the steam engine by James Watt in 1769 was particularly significant, as it provided a new source of power that could drive machinery in factories.\n\nThe textile industry was the first to be transformed. The spinning jenny, water frame, and power loom revolutionized cloth production, increasing output dramatically while reducing costs. This mechanization led to the establishment of large factories, which required workers to operate the machines. As a result, there was a massive migration of people from rural areas to urban centers in search of employment.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution had profound social consequences. Working conditions in early factories were often harsh, with long hours, low wages, and dangerous machinery. Child labor was common, as children could be employed for lower wages than adults. These conditions eventually led to the rise of labor unions and calls for reform.\n\nWhich of the following best describes the main topic of the passage?', 'The invention of the steam engine', 'The transformation of the textile industry', 'The Industrial Revolution and its impacts', 'The migration from rural to urban areas', 'c'),

-- PASSAGE 7: Photosynthesis (Questions 61-70)
('reading', NULL, 61, 'Passage 7:\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize nutrients from carbon dioxide and water. This process is fundamental to life on Earth, as it produces oxygen as a byproduct and forms the base of most food chains. Photosynthesis occurs primarily in the leaves of plants, specifically in structures called chloroplasts that contain the green pigment chlorophyll.\n\nThe process of photosynthesis can be divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, which occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll and converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH. These energy-rich molecules are then used in the Calvin cycle to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.\n\nThe rate of photosynthesis is influenced by several environmental factors. Light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, and temperature all play crucial roles. When light intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis generally increases until a saturation point is reached. Similarly, higher carbon dioxide concentrations typically enhance photosynthetic rates, though this effect also has limits.\n\nWhat is the main purpose of the passage?', 'To describe the discovery of photosynthesis', 'To explain the process and factors affecting photosynthesis', 'To compare different types of plants', 'To discuss the evolution of chloroplasts', 'b'),

-- PASSAGE 8: The History of Writing (Questions 71-80)
('reading', NULL, 71, 'Passage 8:\n\nThe development of writing systems represents one of humanity''s most significant intellectual achievements. The earliest known writing system, cuneiform, emerged in Mesopotamia around 3200 BCE. Initially, cuneiform used pictographic symbols to represent objects and concepts, but it gradually evolved into a more abstract system where symbols represented sounds or syllables.\n\nAround the same time, hieroglyphics developed in ancient Egypt. This writing system combined logographic and alphabetic elements, using pictures to represent words, sounds, or ideas. Hieroglyphics remained in use for over 3,000 years and was employed primarily for religious texts and monumental inscriptions.\n\nThe Phoenician alphabet, developed around 1050 BCE, marked a revolutionary change in writing. Unlike earlier systems that required hundreds or thousands of symbols, the Phoenician alphabet used only 22 characters to represent consonant sounds. This simplicity made literacy much more accessible. The Phoenician alphabet became the ancestor of most modern alphabetic systems, including Greek, Latin, and eventually the English alphabet.\n\nThe invention of writing had profound effects on human civilization. It enabled the preservation of knowledge across generations, facilitated the administration of complex societies, and allowed for the development of literature and recorded history. Without writing, the accumulated knowledge and culture that define modern civilization would not exist.\n\nWhat is the main topic of the passage?', 'The invention of cuneiform', 'Ancient Egyptian culture', 'The development and importance of writing systems', 'The Phoenician civilization', 'c'),

-- PASSAGE 9: Climate Change (Questions 81-90)
('reading', NULL, 81, 'Passage 9:\n\nClimate change refers to long-term shifts in global or regional climate patterns, particularly those occurring since the mid-20th century. While Earth''s climate has changed throughout history, the current warming trend is primarily attributed to human activities, especially the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, creating a "greenhouse effect" that leads to rising global temperatures.\n\nThe consequences of climate change are wide-ranging and increasingly evident. Rising temperatures are causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt, contributing to sea-level rise. This threatens coastal communities and small island nations with flooding and erosion. Additionally, climate change is altering precipitation patterns, leading to more frequent and severe droughts in some regions while causing increased flooding in others.\n\nEcosystems and biodiversity are also under threat. Many species are struggling to adapt to rapidly changing conditions, and some face extinction. Coral reefs, often called the "rainforests of the sea," are particularly vulnerable to warming ocean temperatures, which cause coral bleaching and death.\n\nAddressing climate change requires global cooperation and action. Strategies include reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy adoption, improving energy efficiency, and protecting and restoring forests that absorb carbon dioxide. Many scientists and policymakers emphasize that immediate action is necessary to mitigate the most severe impacts of climate change.\n\nWhat is the main purpose of the passage?', 'To explain the history of Earth''s climate', 'To describe the causes, effects, and solutions to climate change', 'To argue against climate change theories', 'To discuss only the greenhouse effect', 'b'),

-- PASSAGE 10: The Human Brain (Questions 91-100)
('reading', NULL, 91, 'Passage 10:\n\nThe human brain is arguably the most complex organ in the body, containing approximately 86 billion neurons that communicate through trillions of synaptic connections. These neurons form intricate networks that enable all aspects of human cognition, from basic sensory processing to abstract reasoning and creative thought.\n\nThe brain is divided into several distinct regions, each with specialized functions. The cerebral cortex, the brain''s outer layer, is responsible for higher-order thinking, including language, decision-making, and problem-solving. The limbic system, located deeper in the brain, plays a crucial role in emotion and memory formation. The cerebellum, positioned at the back of the brain, coordinates movement and balance.\n\nOne of the brain''s most remarkable features is its plasticity—the ability to reorganize and form new neural connections throughout life. This neuroplasticity allows the brain to adapt to new experiences, learn new skills, and even recover from injuries. Research has shown that learning a new language, musical instrument, or other complex skill can create new neural pathways and strengthen existing ones.\n\nDespite decades of research, many aspects of brain function remain mysterious. Scientists are still working to understand consciousness, the nature of memory storage, and how the brain generates subjective experiences. Advanced imaging technologies, such as functional MRI and PET scans, are providing new insights, but the brain continues to challenge our understanding.\n\nWhat is the main topic of the passage?', 'The number of neurons in the brain', 'The structure, functions, and mysteries of the human brain', 'How to improve brain function', 'The history of brain research', 'b'),

-- PASSAGE 11: Renewable Energy (Questions 101-110)
('reading', NULL, 101, 'Passage 11:\n\nRenewable energy sources, including solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power, are playing an increasingly important role in global energy production. Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and produce greenhouse gases when burned, renewable energy sources are naturally replenished and generate little to no emissions during operation. This makes them crucial in efforts to combat climate change and reduce air pollution.\n\nSolar power harnesses energy from the sun using photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight directly into electricity. The cost of solar panels has decreased dramatically over the past decade, making solar energy increasingly competitive with conventional energy sources. Wind power, generated by turbines that capture kinetic energy from moving air, has also seen significant growth. Modern wind turbines can generate substantial amounts of electricity, especially when installed in areas with consistent wind patterns.\n\nDespite their benefits, renewable energy sources face certain challenges. Solar and wind power are intermittent—they only generate electricity when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. This variability requires the development of energy storage systems, such as batteries, to ensure a stable power supply. Additionally, some renewable energy installations, particularly large wind farms and hydroelectric dams, can have environmental impacts on local ecosystems.\n\nWhat is the main advantage of renewable energy sources mentioned in the passage?', 'They are cheaper than all other energy sources', 'They are naturally replenished and produce little emissions', 'They require no infrastructure', 'They work in all weather conditions', 'b'),

-- PASSAGE 12: Ancient Rome (Questions 111-120)
('reading', NULL, 111, 'Passage 12:\n\nAncient Rome was one of the most influential civilizations in history, lasting for over a thousand years from its legendary founding in 753 BCE until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE. Rome began as a small city-state in central Italy but eventually grew to control a vast empire that stretched from Britain to North Africa and from Spain to the Middle East.\n\nThe Roman Republic, established around 509 BCE, introduced political innovations that influenced later democratic systems. The Republic was governed by elected officials, including consuls and senators, though power was largely held by wealthy patrician families. Over time, conflicts between patricians and plebeians (common citizens) led to reforms that gave plebeians more political rights.\n\nRoman engineering and architecture were remarkably advanced. The Romans built an extensive network of roads that facilitated trade and military movement throughout the empire. They also constructed aqueducts to transport water to cities, some of which are still standing today. Roman architectural innovations, such as the arch and concrete, enabled the construction of massive structures like the Colosseum and the Pantheon.\n\nRoman culture had a lasting impact on Western civilization. Latin, the language of Rome, became the basis for the Romance languages, including Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. Roman law, particularly the concept of legal rights and citizenship, influenced modern legal systems. Even after its fall, Rome''s legacy continued through the Byzantine Empire and profoundly shaped European culture and thought.\n\nWhat is the main topic of the passage?', 'The fall of the Roman Empire', 'The innovations and lasting influence of ancient Rome', 'Roman military conquests', 'The Latin language', 'b'),

-- PASSAGE 13: Sleep and Health (Questions 121-130)
('reading', NULL, 121, 'Passage 13:\n\nSleep is a fundamental biological need that plays a crucial role in maintaining physical and mental health. During sleep, the body undergoes numerous restorative processes, including tissue repair, muscle growth, and the consolidation of memories. Despite its importance, many people fail to get adequate sleep due to busy schedules, stress, or sleep disorders.\n\nThe recommended amount of sleep varies by age, but most adults need between seven and nine hours per night. Sleep occurs in cycles, each lasting approximately 90 minutes and consisting of different stages. These stages include light sleep, deep sleep, and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. Each stage serves distinct functions: deep sleep is particularly important for physical restoration, while REM sleep is crucial for cognitive functions such as learning and memory.\n\nChronic sleep deprivation has serious health consequences. Studies have linked insufficient sleep to increased risks of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and weakened immune function. Sleep deprivation also impairs cognitive performance, affecting attention, decision-making, and reaction time. This is particularly dangerous for activities requiring alertness, such as driving.\n\nImproving sleep quality involves practicing good "sleep hygiene."

-- PASSAGE 15: Biodiversity (Questions 141-150)
('reading', NULL, 141, 'Passage 15:\n\nBiodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth, encompassing the diversity of species, genetic variation within species, and the variety of ecosystems. High biodiversity is essential for the stability and resilience of ecosystems, as diverse systems are better able to withstand environmental changes and disturbances. Unfortunately, biodiversity is declining at an alarming rate due to human activities.\n\nHabitat destruction is the leading cause of biodiversity loss. As forests are cleared for agriculture, urban development, and logging, countless species lose their homes and food sources. Tropical rainforests, which contain more than half of the world''s species despite covering only about 7% of Earth''s land surface, are particularly vulnerable. Deforestation in these regions has severe consequences for global biodiversity.\n\nOther threats to biodiversity include pollution, climate change, overexploitation of resources, and the introduction of invasive species. Invasive species can outcompete native species for resources, disrupt food chains, and alter habitats. Climate change is forcing species to adapt to new conditions or migrate to more suitable environments, but many species cannot adapt quickly enough or have nowhere to go.\n\nConserving biodiversity requires coordinated efforts at local, national, and international levels. Strategies include establishing protected areas such as national parks and wildlife reserves, enforcing laws against poaching and illegal logging, restoring degraded habitats, and promoting sustainable resource use. Additionally, raising public awareness about the importance of biodiversity is crucial for long-term conservation success.\n\nWhat is the main topic of the passage?', 'The definition of biodiversity', 'The importance of biodiversity, threats to it, and conservation strategies', 'The benefits of deforestation', 'Specific endangered species', 'b'),

-- PASSAGE 16: Memory (Questions 151-160)
('reading', NULL, 151, 'Passage 16:\n\nMemory is the cognitive process by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. Psychologists generally divide memory into three main types: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Each type plays a distinct role in how we process and retain information.\n\nSensory memory holds information from our senses for a very brief period, typically less than a second. This allows us to retain impressions of sensory information after the original stimulus has ceased. Short-term memory, also called working memory, can hold a limited amount of information (usually about 7 items) for approximately 20-30 seconds. This is the type of memory we use when remembering a phone number long enough to dial it.\n\nLong-term memory has a much larger capacity and can store information for extended periods, from days to a lifetime. Long-term memory is further divided into explicit memory (conscious memories of facts and events) and implicit memory (unconscious memories such as skills and habits). The process of transferring information from short-term to long-term memory is called consolidation, and it is strengthened through repetition and meaningful association.\n\nSeveral factors can affect memory performance. Sleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation. Stress and anxiety can impair memory formation and retrieval. Age-related changes in the brain can affect memory, though normal aging does not necessarily lead to severe memory loss. Techniques such as mnemonics, visualization, and spacing out study sessions can improve memory retention.\n\nWhat is the main purpose of the passage?', 'To discuss memory disorders', 'To explain the types of memory and factors affecting it', 'To teach memory improvement techniques', 'To describe brain anatomy', 'b'),

-- PASSAGE 17: The Renaissance (Questions 161-170)
('reading', NULL, 161, 'Passage 17:\n\nThe Renaissance was a cultural movement that began in Italy in the 14th century and spread throughout Europe over the next few centuries. The term "Renaissance" means "rebirth," referring to the renewed interest in the classical learning and values of ancient Greece and Rome. This period marked a transition from the Middle Ages to modernity and brought significant changes in art, science, literature, and philosophy.\n\nRenaissance art was characterized by realism, perspective, and humanism. Artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael created works that demonstrated a deep understanding of human anatomy and emotion. The development of linear perspective allowed artists to create the illusion of depth on flat surfaces, making paintings appear more realistic than ever before.\n\nThe Renaissance also witnessed remarkable scientific progress. Nicolaus Copernicus challenged the geocentric view of the universe, proposing that the Earth orbited the Sun rather than vice versa. Galileo Galilei made astronomical observations that supported this heliocentric model and developed the scientific method of systematic observation and experimentation. These advances laid the groundwork for the Scientific Revolution.\n\nThe invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg around 1440 had a profound impact on the Renaissance. Books became more affordable and accessible, facilitating the spread of knowledge and ideas. This technological innovation contributed to increased literacy rates and helped disseminate Renaissance ideals throughout Europe.\n\nWhat is the main topic of the passage?', 'Italian history', 'The characteristics and impacts of the Renaissance', 'The life of Leonardo da Vinci', 'Medieval European art', 'b'),

-- PASSAGE 18: Ocean Currents (Questions 171-180)
('reading', NULL, 171, 'Passage 18:\n\nOcean currents are continuous, directed movements of seawater generated by forces acting upon the water, including wind, the Coriolis effect, temperature and salinity differences, and tides. These currents play a vital role in regulating global climate by redistributing heat from the equator toward the poles. Understanding ocean currents is essential for predicting weather patterns, navigation, and studying marine ecosystems.\n\nSurface currents, which affect the upper 400 meters of the ocean, are primarily driven by wind. The Gulf Stream, for example, is a powerful warm current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows along the eastern coast of the United States before crossing the Atlantic toward Europe. This current significantly moderates the climate of Western Europe, making it much warmer than other regions at similar latitudes.\n\nDeep ocean currents, also known as thermohaline circulation, are driven by differences in water density, which is affected by temperature (thermo) and salinity (haline). Cold, salty water is denser and sinks, while warm, less salty water rises. This creates a global "conveyor belt" of water that circulates slowly throughout the world''s oceans, taking hundreds or thousands of years to complete a full cycle.\n\nClimate change poses potential threats to ocean currents. As polar ice melts, it adds fresh water to the ocean, which could disrupt the density-driven currents. Changes in ocean currents could have far-reaching effects on climate patterns, marine life, and human societies that depend on stable climatic conditions.\n\nWhat is the main idea of the passage?', 'How to navigate using ocean currents', 'The role and types of ocean currents and threats to them', 'The history of oceanography', 'Marine life in the ocean', 'b'),

-- PASSAGE 19: Vaccines (Questions 181-190)
('reading', NULL, 181, 'Passage 19:\n\nVaccines are one of the most important medical innovations in history, having saved millions of lives by preventing infectious diseases. A vaccine works by stimulating the body''s immune system to recognize and fight specific pathogens without causing the disease itself. This is typically achieved by introducing a weakened or inactivated form of the pathogen, or a piece of it, into the body.\n\nWhen a vaccine is administered, the immune system responds by producing antibodies—proteins that can recognize and neutralize the pathogen. The immune system also develops "memory cells" that remember the pathogen. If the person is later exposed to the actual disease, these memory cells enable the immune system to respond quickly and effectively, often preventing illness entirely or reducing its severity.\n\nVaccination not only protects individuals but also contributes to "herd immunity." When a large percentage of a population is vaccinated, the spread of disease is significantly reduced, protecting even those who cannot be vaccinated, such as infants, pregnant women, or individuals with compromised immune systems. This collective immunity is crucial for controlling and even eradicating infectious diseases.\n\nDespite overwhelming scientific evidence of their safety and effectiveness, vaccines have faced opposition from some groups. Misinformation and myths about vaccines have led to decreased vaccination rates in some areas, resulting in outbreaks of preventable diseases such as measles. Public health officials emphasize the importance of vaccination and work to address concerns through education and transparent communication.\n\nWhat is the main purpose of the passage?', 'To describe how to manufacture vaccines', 'To explain how vaccines work and their importance', 'To discuss the history of all diseases', 'To argue against vaccination', 'b'),

-- PASSAGE 20: Urbanization (Questions 191-200)
('reading', NULL, 191, 'Passage 20:\n\nUrbanization is the process by which an increasing percentage of a population comes to live in cities and urban areas. This phenomenon has accelerated dramatically over the past century. In 1900, only about 13% of the world''s population lived in urban areas; by 2020, this figure had risen to over 56%, and it continues to grow. This rapid urbanization has profound implications for economies, societies, and the environment.\n\nEconomically, cities serve as engines of growth and innovation. They concentrate resources, infrastructure, and human capital, creating opportunities for businesses and workers. Urban areas typically offer higher wages, better access to education and healthcare, and more diverse employment opportunities than rural areas. This economic advantage is a primary driver of rural-to-urban migration.\n\nHowever, rapid urbanization also presents significant challenges. Many cities struggle to provide adequate housing, infrastructure, and services for their growing populations. This can lead to the development of informal settlements or slums, where residents lack access to basic amenities such as clean water, sanitation, and electricity. Traffic congestion, air pollution, and strain on public services are common problems in rapidly growing cities.\n\nEnvironmentally, urbanization has both positive and negative effects. Dense cities can be more energy-efficient than sprawling suburban development, as they enable the use of public transportation and reduce the need for private vehicles. However, urban areas also contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, generate large amounts of waste, and can disrupt local ecosystems. Sustainable urban planning, which emphasizes green spaces, efficient public transportation, and environmentally friendly building practices, is essential for creating livable cities in the future.\n\nWhat is the main topic of the passage?', 'The history of cities', 'The process, impacts, and challenges of urbanization', 'Rural life advantages', 'Environmental pollution only', 'b'),
